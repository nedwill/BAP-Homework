k-length call graph

void f()
{
  return g();
}

void g()
{
  return f();
}

We will never see (f,f,f,f) or (g,g,g,g)

But we have two unique call chains of length 4:
(f,g,f,g), (g,f,g,f)
So a better stopping condition might saturating all possible call strings of length <= k

We still have termination because there are a finite number of length k call chains taken from the set of functions, of which some subset is reachable.
